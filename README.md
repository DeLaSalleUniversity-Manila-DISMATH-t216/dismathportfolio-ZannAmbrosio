#Week 1
- I was introduced to a new and exciting subject, Discrete Mathematics.
- At first I thought that this would be a great term for me, but because of DISMATH, it is now the best.
- I had difficulty absorbing the topics at first, but at second and third glance to my notes, I was able to get it at last.
- We were taught about mathematical proofs, truth, truth tables, and logical connectives. 

#Week 2
- We were taught about Logical Equivalences.
- This part is really fun, because it's just like the operations in Algebra.
- We were able to do exercises on simplifying and evaluating statements using logical equivalences, and I sort of got the hang of it.
- We were also taught about predicate logic and quantifiers.
- I have learned that an **Existential Quantifier** means that there exist a true value in the possible values for a statement, while a **Universal Quantifier** means that the statement is true for all possible values.

#Week 3
- We were given the assignment to prove that superman does not exist.
- We were taught about Rules of Inference
- We tried answering different problems (ex. Problem about proving the conclusion that they will be home by sunset) using rules of inference and countercheck it with a truth table.
- We were taught about Modus Ponens, Modus Tollens, Hyphothetical Syllogism, Disjunctive syllogism, Addition, Simplification, Conjunction, and Resolution.

#Week 4
- During the first week, I thought it will be just pure fun, but at this point, I am doubting everything I have learned about the 
English language so far. I can't believe how something that sounds nonsense and illogical to the English language can actually have sense
and be logical.
- We were taught about methods of proof: direct proof, proof by contraposition, vacuous and trivial proof, and proof by contraposition.
- We were able to prove statements using these proofs and we were taught what method to use based on the statements as well.
- Proof by contraposition is entirely different from proof by contradiction. Sir Cabatuan emphasized that these two methods are the commonly
mistaken ones by students. **Proof by contraposition** deals with the contrapositive of the original statement. First, we have to assume that
not Q is true, then show that not P is also true, to prove that the statement is true. On the other hand, **Proof by Contradiction** deals with 
the whole statement's inverse as true. First, we have to assume that the inverse of statement A is true, and then we have to show that this 
leads to a contradiction, thus proving the original statement true.
